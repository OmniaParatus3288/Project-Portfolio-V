# Project & Portfolio V: Cybersecurity

Welcome to my Project & Portfolio V repository! This project reflects my work at Full Sail University, where I explored the secure software development lifecycle, threat modeling, security maturity assessments, and the creation of a comprehensive security plan for a case study company, SnowBe Online.

## 🎯 Course Objectives

In this course, I:

✅ Analyzed software and system development life cycles for security considerations  
✅ Developed secure software design and threat modeling practices  
✅ Assessed organizational security maturity using CMMC and other models  
✅ Created a comprehensive organizational security plan and policy documents  
✅ Practiced critical thinking in technical decision-making and security program planning

### Week 1 – Software Development Framework Decision

- Evaluated frameworks for SnowBe Online:
  - **NIST SSDF**
  - Microsoft SDL
- Selected **NIST SSDF** because:
  - Embeds security into all SDLC phases
  - Flexible for small teams and new processes
  - Aligns with NIST 800-53 and PCI DSS requirements
  - Supports supply chain security for modern threats
- Defined roles for SnowBe’s new dev team:
  - Karen – Project Manager & Security Lead
  - Developer 1 – Frontend Security
  - Developer 2 – Backend Security
  - Developer 3 – DevOps & Security Automation
- Planned adoption of Agile and DevSecOps principles for rapid development and security integration

### Week 2 – System Development Life Cycle Planning

- Applied **NIST SP 800-160 v1** for SnowBe’s system life cycle:
  - Acquisition strategy planning
  - Supplier management
  - Risk and incident management
- Prioritized key processes:
  - Project Planning (OP.1)
  - Risk Management (OP.2)
  - Configuration Management (OP.6)
- Emphasized:
  - Early threat modeling

### Week 3 – Security Maturity & CMMC Assessment

- Evaluated SnowBe’s security maturity using:
  - CMMC Framework
  - Simple Maturity Model
- Identified priority security domains:
  - Incident Response (IR)
  - Access Control (AC)
  - System & Communications Protection (SC)
  - Configuration Management (CM)
- Documented maturity levels and next steps:

### Week 4 – Threat Modeling & Security Plan Development

- Integrated threat modeling into:
  - System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
  - Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)
- Applied shift-left security practices to:
  - Catch vulnerabilities early
  - Align security with business objectives
- Completed a comprehensive security plan for SnowBe Online covering:
  - Roles & responsibilities
  - Security policies and standards
